<p> HS-ROIM-081-T2 <br> Walk With Me: A Cheap and Effective Implementation of AI on the White Cane </p>

<em> <p> Legally blind individuals must rely on a variety of tools such as guide dogs and white canes. 
However, guide dogs are expensive and require responsibility and white canes are cumbersome to use. 
The smart cane can detect obstacles in the user’s path ahead of time to create a safe route for the user. 
While smart canes exist, most range from $500-1000, which is an expense many blind individuals cannot afford. 
Thus, Walk with Me is a smart cane 1/10th of the market price costing about $61. 
After multiple iterations, this is the most effective and cost-efficient solution which only uses an ultrasonic sensor and a camera. 
The camera utilizes advanced computer vision technology, YOLOv5, to distinguish possible obstacles and their distances. 
This information is transformed into tactile output to the user’s hand through vibration motors. 
This approach is simple, cost-effective, and practical, making it ideal for daily use. 
Our object detection model has a 96% success rate in identifying obstacles. 
We collected data by testing our product with obstacle courses and around the neighborhood. 
We found that we collided with close to none of the obstacles in our trials and only took 2-3 more minutes 
compared to the average person for a walk around the neighborhood.
Walk with me is an innovative take on smart canes making it affordable and accessible to all.
